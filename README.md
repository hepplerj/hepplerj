### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Jason Heppler](https://jasonheppler.org), a developer, historian, and educator working at the intersection of history, computation, data visualization, and public history. I am scholar in data visualization and information design, digital history, environmental history, and public history. I am currently the senior web developer at the [Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu) at George Mason University. I also serve as the Research Director for the [American Indian Digital History Project](https://aidhp.com).

In my work, I've collaborated with several different groups of researchers and practitioners including the [Spatial History Project](http://spatialhistory.stanford.edu), [Humanities+Design](http://hdlab.stanford.edu), the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org), the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/mozilla-open-leaders/), the [Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](https://cdrh.unl.edu), the [American Historical Association](https://www.historians.org), the [Western History Association](https://www.westernhistory.org), and others at George Mason University, the University of Nebraska at Omaha, Stanford University, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Among my work with data, I am the co-founder of [Endangered Data Week](https://endangereddataweek.org) intended to promote care for endangered collections, open government, community data privacy, and data ethics.

In my own research, I'm an environmental and urban historian and examine landscape change and the ways that people enact (and react) to such changes. I am currently completing my second book on the environmental history of Silicon Valley following World War II. Generally, I am interested in the ways computation, data, and design can be employed to help us understand space and place through maps, texts, and visual culture.
